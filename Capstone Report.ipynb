The research question is rather a sociological one than a business problem. The idea is to check, whether the neighborhoods of one city wil end up in one cluster or whether there are similar neighborhood structures that exists in different countries. This can be a signal of whether the national culture is dominant or local cultures develop on their own. \nThe two cities analyzed are New York and Toronto. For forther research the analysis could be run multiple times to see whether characteristics of the country have an impact on which culture (nationall or local) is the more important one."

Both places are rather similar, as they belong to the western world and are in Noth America. Still they belong to different countries and may have different local traditions which are reflected in the local venue structure."

For those Neighborhoods all available venues are listet including categoy.\n\nAs Input for Clustering the data are normalized by calculating the share of the venue categories by Neighborhood.\nThe Clustering of Neighborhoods is done usind the kmeans algorithm. This method builds clusters that are most similar within and diverse between clusters. The analysis is carried out with only 8 clusters and a random starting point for each cluster center. As clustering is a technique of unsupervised learning the results are interpreted and discussed but no statistical testing is applied.\n\n\n   If the national culture dominate the local one, then I would expect to see clusters either only in Manhatten Neighborhoods or in Toronto neighborhoods. If the local culture is the stronger one, then we may find neighborhoods of the same cluster in both New York and Toronto\n"

Cluster 0 appears in both Toronto and New York. This might be a \"Noth American urban culture\" Cluster. The second big cluster (number 4) includes also a wide range of Neighborhoods but nearly only appears in New York. This might represent an urban US Cluster.\nIt can further be seen, that New York is by far more divers than Toronto.\nIn New York it is interessting to note, that the two dominant clusters (red and blue) are split locally. You can see that on the map (see presentation or skript)\n\n"

In order to test this assumption it would be a good idea to further analyse other american citis, e.g. LA or San Fransisco. If the cluster is a typical urban american Cluster we would find it in these cities as well. Otherewise it might be a special New York culture.\n\nApart from cluster 0 and 4, the others are quote smaller. They seem to be somehow special.\nLets look at the very special clusters. \n\n- Cluster 5 is small but appears both in Toronto an New York. It contains neighboorhoods whichs most dominant venues are parks\n\n- Cluster 3 covers 7 neighboorhoods but only exists in New York. They are all in Staten Island. \n\n"

Apart from that both cities have neighborhoods which are very special and have no common part in the other city. This is for example Staten Island which seems to have strong local subculture.\n\n\nExtending the analysis may help to find more interesting results.\nI recommend analyzing at least two cities for each country and also analyzing a country that differs from Canada and US. E.g. adding a central European country and an Asian one."
