The idea is to check, whether the neighborhoods of one city wil end up in one cluster or whether there are similar neighborhood structures that exists in different countries. This can be a signal of whether ne national culture is dominant or local cultures develop on their on.\nThe analysis could be run multiple times to see whether characteristics of the country have an impact on which culture (nationall or local) is the more important one. \n\n"
